* **ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:** Modern front-end frameworks like **React** or **Vue.js** to enhance the Well-Bot visualization module, and exploring **Docker** for deployment.

* **ðŸ’» I'm interested in:** **Full-Stack Development** (especially the integration of data visualization with back-end APIs), **AI/ML for HealthTech**, and **Software Architecture**.

### ðŸ’¬ Let's Connect

* **ðŸ¤” Ask me about:** **Software Engineering** concepts, my journey at **UM**, or **[a specific technology you're good at, e.g., Python, Java, SQL]**.

* **ðŸ“« How to reach me:** You can send me an email at **hengxiaoxuan2003@gmail.com**.
